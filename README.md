### 👋 Hi, I'm Danil — QA Engineer

4+ years in backend-heavy systems: fintech, AI-driven compliance, telemedicine, and high-load B2C platforms.  
Focus on **quality in distributed architectures:** backend, APIs, async flows, messaging, and data consistency.

### 🔧 Core Skills & Tools
- **Backend & Integration Testing:** REST (Postman, Swagger), SOAP (SoapUI)
- **Async / Data Pipelines:** Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (SELECT / JOIN / aggregates), DBeaver
- **Debug & Observability:** Kibana, Sentry, Charles, DevTools
- **Web & Mobile Testing:** Chrome DevTools, Firebase App, TestFlight
- **CI/CD & Teamwork:** GitLab, Confluence, Jira, Zephyr, Scrum

### 🧠 Work Approach
- Build **test coverage around real business processes**, not just cases-on-paper
- Trace issues to the **exact cause** using logs & service-to-service event chains
- Treat web, mobile, and backend as a **single integrated system**

### ⚙️ Currently Learning
**Python + Pytest** — building a practical automation layer to speed up regression testing and reinforce critical flows.

### 🌍 Work Preferences
- Remote-first mindset  
- English — **C2**
